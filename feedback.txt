Viktor: Volunteers for animals care website with registration
The project is working, it is made with Flask.
Flask modules and methods were precisly implemented, the Database is working
and the relationships between the tables is well implemented.
OOP with decorator was used through Flask structure.
I just wish you could use also json and API. 
An idea for that would be an API to show the regions of volunteers in a map

Python OOP:9/10
Modules: 9/10
